- Manage Hospitals: create, retrieve, update, delete hospital records
- Manage Doctors: create, retrieve, update, delete doctor records
- Manage Hospital-Doctor relationships, including assigning roles
- Search functionality for hospitals and doctors by name
- Pagination support for listing endpoints

## Tech Stack

- **Go (Golang)** for backend development
- **PostgreSQL** as the primary relational database
- **github.com/jmoiron/sqlx** for SQL database interaction
- **Gorilla Mux** for HTTP routing
- Middleware management for global and route-level middleware support
- JSON-based REST API responses

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.20+ installed ([download here](https://golang.org/dl/))
- PostgreSQL installed and running
- `medidhaka` database created with required tables (see [Database Schema](#database-schema) below)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Md-Shajib/MediDhaka_Backend.git
   cd medidhaka
2. Configure your PostgreSQL connection string in db/connection.go:
    ```bash
    func GetConnectionString() string {
        return "user=db_userName password=db_password host=your_host port=db_port dbname=your_db_name sslmode=disable"
    }
3. Run migrations or manually create tables
4. Build and run the server:
   ```bash
   go build -o medidhaka ./cmd/server
    ./medidhaka
5. API server listens on port 8080 by default. Otherwise you have to define the port. Here I am using .env file to set the port.

## Middleware

- CORS Middleware: Allows cross-origin resource sharing by setting appropriate headers.

- Middleware Manager: Supports registering global and route-specific middlewares with clean chaining.
